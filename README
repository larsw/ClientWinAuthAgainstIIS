1. Open in VS2012 with admin rights
2. Open the Properties -> Web page on the Web project (ClientWinAuthAgainstIIS)
3. Use local IIS Web Server -> Create Virtual Directory

4. Open the IIS Management Console
5. Navigate to the newly created application
6. (Security) Authentication -> Enable Windows Authentication, disable all others.

7. Build solution.
8. Ensure that the Client project is set as the Startup project
9. Hit F5.
10. The console output is hopefully "Hello world".

PS: Oh yes, to create a full blown web app (ASP.NET MVC 4 with a Web API controller) for displaying "Hello world" 
is of course a classic example of gold plating :)
